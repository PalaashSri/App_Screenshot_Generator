There are two folders present in this repository: Droidbot_Script&Data and Google_Play_Scraper_Script&Data

* Droidbot_Script&Data contains the script "droidbot_script.py" which is used to obtain app screenshots and information generated by droidbot and process them to generate app store screenshots. It also contains a folder "UpdatedImages" which contains the final app screenshots generated by the script for a Notepad application. Note that developers will need to select some images to showcase on their app store page as not all final images are suitable for app store listing. 

* Google_Play_Scraper_Script&Data contains script "app_scrapper.py" which contains code to utilize the Google Play Scraper functionality and obtain information like screenshot and app description for multiple applications from the Google Play Store and save these information in different files. imageUrlDatabase.txt contains url for 616 app screenshots. image_dataset folder contains these 616 downloaded app screenshot images and imageTextDatabase contains text that is present on each image in the image_dataset folder.

* To download droidbot: https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot

The droidbot_script.py script utilizes information outputted from running droidbot while app_scrapper.py script imports the downloaded google-play-scrapper to perform its tasks. 

<b> Note: </b> To run app_scrapper.py, you need to install pytesseract using `pip install pytesseract` and need to mention its downloaded path in the app_scrapper.py script. For more information on installation: https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
